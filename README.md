## Information

Something I wanted to make in Rust was a simple api wrapper, picked something and the rest was history.
**Much of it is still a work in progress.**

- The former versions **`<= 2.*`** used a different API, and to migrate to the new one, a lot of changes needed to happen to adjust.

If you wish to help out, you can. I am a beginner in Rust and I do not mind a few pointers.
