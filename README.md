## Information
Something I wanted to make in Rust was a simple api wrapper, picked something and the rest was history.
Much of it is still a WIP, and it probably will not be put on crates.io until it is to a point of completion.

## Contributing
If you wish to help out, you can. I am a beginner in Rust, and I do not mind a few pointers.
